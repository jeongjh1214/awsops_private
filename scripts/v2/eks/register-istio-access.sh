# Grant the AWSops agent Lambda role READ access (AmazonEKSViewPolicy, cluster scope) on EKS
# cluster(s) so the istio-read MCP can LIST Istio CRDs via the Kubernetes API.
#
# Run this as an operator WHO HOLDS cluster permissions (eks:CreateAccessEntry +
# eks:AssociateAccessPolicy). AWSops deliberately does NOT create this access entry in terraform —
# granting a principal k8s access is the cluster owner's call (read-only stance; the apply principal
# may not own third-party clusters). Re-running is safe (already-exists is tolerated).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/v2/eks/register-istio-access.sh <cluster-name> [<cluster-name> ...]
#   ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::...:role/awsops-v2-agent-lambda scripts/v2/eks/register-istio-access.sh <cluster>
#
# The agent Lambda role ARN is read from `terraform output -raw agent_lambda_role_arn` unless ROLE_ARN
# is set.
#
# POLICY = AmazonEKSViewPolicy (least privilege): maps to the k8s `view` ClusterRole — read on
# namespaced resources + namespaces, but NOT Secrets and NOT cluster-scoped resources (nodes etc.).
# istio-read only LISTs namespaced Istio CRDs + namespaces, so `view` suffices. Istio's standard
# install aggregates its CRD read perms into `view` (rbac aggregate-to-view). If a cluster lacks that
# aggregation, the operator additionally applies a minimal istio-reader ClusterRole (see runbook) —
# do NOT widen to AdminView (that would grant cluster-wide Secret read to an automated agent).
