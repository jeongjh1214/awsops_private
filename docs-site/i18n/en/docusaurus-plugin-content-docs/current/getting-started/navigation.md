# Layout & Themes

A page for getting familiar with the AWSops layout — sidebar navigation, the command palette, themes, and the mobile layout.

## Features

### Left Sidebar

A fixed area on the left of the screen — the primary way to reach every page.

- **Header**: the **AWSops** mark and a **한/EN** language toggle
- **Pinned top items**: **Overview**, **AI Diagnosis**, **Assistant**, **Jobs**, **Cost**, **Bedrock**, **Topology**, **Custom Agents**, **Datasources**
- **Resource inventory groups**: below those come the **Compute** (EKS, EC2, Lambda, ECS Clusters, ECS Tasks, ECR), **Storage & DB**, **Network**, **Security**, and **Monitoring** groups
- **Footer**: your signed-in identity and **Sign out**, the region/connection status, and the theme picker
- The page you are currently viewing is shown with a highlight

### Command Palette (Cmd-K)

A search box for jumping anywhere from the keyboard.

- Open it from any page with **Cmd-K** (macOS) or **Ctrl-K** (Windows/Linux)
- Type a page name, resource type, or part of a path to filter
- Use the **Up/Down arrows** to move, **Enter** to go, and **Esc** to close
- Beyond navigation, the **Theme: Cobalt / Teal / Dark** entries switch the theme directly

### Themes

Pick the app's color scheme from the 3-way theme picker in the bottom-left (sidebar footer).

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Cobalt** | Default. A light cobalt palette |
| **Teal** | A light teal palette |
| **Dark** | A dark mode |

- Your choice is saved in the browser and persists across reloads
- Charts and the **AWSops** mark adapt their colors to the selected theme

### Mobile Layout

When the screen is narrow (under 1024px), the layout automatically switches to a mobile layout.

- **Top bar**: a hamburger menu, the page title, and a search (command palette) icon
- **Bottom tab bar**: five tabs — **Overview · Cost · Inventory · Assistant · More**
- Tapping the **More** tab or the hamburger opens a **slide-in drawer** with the full menu

## How to Use

1. On desktop, click a menu item in the **left sidebar** to open the page you want.
2. Press **Cmd-K** (or **Ctrl-K**) to open the command palette, type a page name, and press **Enter** to go.
3. In the sidebar footer's theme picker, click **Cobalt**, **Teal**, or **Dark**.
4. On mobile, switch between key pages with the bottom tabs, and open the rest from **More**.
5. From any page, open the chat with the floating **AI assistant button**.

:::tip Fastest way to jump
When there are many pages, typing part of a name into **Cmd-K** beats scanning the sidebar. Type `Theme:` in the palette to switch themes instantly too.

:::info Timestamps
