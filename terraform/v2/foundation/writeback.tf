# terraform/v2/foundation/writeback.tf
# AWSops v2 ADR-034 — RCA write-back (observability-write tier). EVERY resource here is gated by
# var.rca_writeback_enabled (local.rwb; default false => count=0 => ZERO write-back infra, ZERO cost,
# ZERO OpsCenter / Incident-Manager write). The webhook marker-drop ingress filter is ALWAYS-ON and
# lives in the web BFF (independent of this flag) — it is the feedback-loop safety control.
#
# REUSES the 029/036 action_opscenter_write role (remediation.tf) for the OpsItem write; adds ONLY the
# Incident Manager per-action role + the write-back SSM config params here. The WriteBack stage Lambda
# (aws_lambda_function.incident_writeback) and its IAM wiring live in incidents.tf (it ships in the
# incident_src archive and runs as a stage of the incident SM, spliced in only when local.rwb).
#
# REQUIRES incident_lifecycle_enabled=true (the write-back is a stage of the incident SM and reads
# incidents.rca) AND remediation_enabled=true (reuses the opscenter-create-opsitem catalog action +
# the action_opscenter_write per-action role). See variables.tf (rca_writeback_enabled).
#
# SAFETY: the write-back is BEST-EFFORT NON-BLOCKING (a write failure never blocks the primary
# Slack/SNS notification) and recommendation-only ("AWSops recommendation", never "confirmed root
# cause"). The single AWS write is performed UNDER an assumed per-action role (#1), is MARKED
# (CreatedBy=AWSops-AIOps) so the always-on ingress filter drops the resulting echo, and is single-
# operator (NO 4-eyes — this is NOT the /api/actions mutating path).

# so the same assumed session can confirm the target record.
