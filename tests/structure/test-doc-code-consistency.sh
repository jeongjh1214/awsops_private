# Doc↔code consistency: CLAUDE.md must name the EKS access-entry policy the code actually binds.
#
# The web task role's EKS Access Entry is associated with AmazonEKSAdminViewPolicy
# (terraform/v2/foundation/eks.tf:34) — NOT AmazonEKSViewPolicy. Plain View has no cluster-scoped
# resources, so it can't list nodes (see the eks.tf comment); AmazonEKSViewPolicy is used ONLY for
# the separate, out-of-band istio-read role (eks.tf:46), which CLAUDE.md does not document.
#
# Assertions are scoped to CLAUDE.md (NOT repo-wide — eks.tf legitimately keeps AmazonEKSViewPolicy
# for the istio role) and use fixed-string matching (grep -F) to avoid any regex ambiguity. The "Admin"
# prefix breaks both forbidden literals (" + View" != " + AdminView"; "EKSViewPolicy" != "EKSAdminViewPolicy"),
# so the corrected "AdminView" text cannot false-fail.
#
# Standalone, no deps (no vitest/tfvars/node): bash tests/structure/test-doc-code-consistency.sh
